What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

As you are working you may make a branch to change some stuff or add some functionality. While you are doing
this some other coworker may have already committed new changes to the main branch. If you want to commit your changes to the main branch
you will have to update his changes into your branch as well. You can do git merge or rebase for this. What git merge does is
take the newest version of the main branch and the branch you are on and merge them both into one final state, where of course you will
have to figure out whether there are merge conflicts and solve them. Git rebase on the other hand will implement your functionality changes into
the main branch directly and have the latest version of the main branch point to the first version of your branch, making it a more linear
history. Doing git merge too much can cause disorginization, but they are both useful.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repository that is kept on a network, this remote
repository can be cloned by people who want to work on it and then it is a
local repository on their system.
